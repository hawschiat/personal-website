    My friend [Mike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-di-genova-732b3913b/) approached me in July 2018 asking me if there's an easy way to scrape inventory data across all branches on [SAQ's website](https://www.saq.com/en/). Since SAQ doesn't provide any public API for us to query data from, I decided to write a scraper to pull data from the website directly.


    Initially, only a portion of data is loaded. Subsequent data can only be fetched after clicking a specific button. Using Selenium ChromeDriver, I managed to automate that process and fetch the data that he needs!


    This project was written using Kotlin. It also provides a command-line user interface to input parameters such as the web URL to fetch the data from.


    P.S. If you like vodka, be sure to check out [Prose Vodka](https://www.prosevodka.com/). It is the first pink, potato-based vodka in the world! ;)

    A medium-sized game development project that involves 5 people. We used [PyGame](https://pygame.org) and several other Python libraries to develop a video game based on FlashPoint, a board game. The video game is co-op and turn based, and the clients communicate with each other using peer-to-peer architecture.


    Some of the things I did include:

    - Built customizable UI components from the basic shapes provided by the library

    - Worked on the networking component of the game

    This was the project I did with my friend [Francis](https://github.com/francis-piche) during McHacks 2018. It was my first time experimenting with HTML canvas and interactive JavaScript. Despite being beginners, we managed to complete several features such as drag-and-drop and animated sprites.


    This project got me really interested in Javascript and pushed me to self-learn it on my own!
